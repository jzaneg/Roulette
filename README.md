# Roulette
---
This application mimics the classic casino 'Roulette' game. Primarily coded in C# I intend to use a fully funcitonal GUI for the user to interact with the game using HTMl, CSS, and JavaSctipt. I also want to add in Node.js similar to socket.io to create an online game room to have friends log in to play.

## Built With
- C#
- HTML
- CSS 
- JavaScript
- Node.js

### Project Phases
---
-1. Initial CSharp code written to meet all functionality of the game. (Betting | Spinning the wheel | et.).

    In Progress

-2.Code front end GUI using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Need both Roulette Wheel and board.

    Awaiting step 1.

-3.Code Node.js to allow for a live room/chat environment to allow users to interact and connnect and play.

    Awaiting step 2.
    
-4.Testing and Deployment

    Awaiting step 3.
### What I learned
---
So far, I've been challenged to incorporate a ton of mathematical logic to provide the functionality behind the game. This has been a fun process so far and I'm excited to keep this project moving forward.
